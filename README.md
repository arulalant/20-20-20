========================

Need to give 
* Edit/Preferences option to control on/off, sleep for few hours/days
* Background movie pause options (when popups)
* Alaram sound play when it popup closes
* Disable keyboard (so user can not switch program via atl+tab or alt+shift+tab or super+tab 
* It should not popup when user is idle
* Auto back ground run
* Binary release (deb, rpm) to install via single mouse click
